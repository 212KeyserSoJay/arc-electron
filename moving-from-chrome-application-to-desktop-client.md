# Moving From Chrome Application To Desktop Client

## Step 1: install desktop client

Go to [https://install.advancedrestclient.com/install](https://install.advancedrestclient.com/install) to install latest version of Advanced REST Client if you haven't already.

## Step 2: export data from Chrome application

Open Chrome application. You can recognize it by green baner in the left-bottom corner saying "**Install new ARC with new features!**"

In the top right application menu select Import and export data.

This opens a dialog to save the file on disk. Select any location to store the file. We will use this file later to import it in desktop client.

## Step 3: import data to desktop client

Once the data export from Chrome application is ready import it to the desktop client.

Open Advanced REST Client desktop application.

{% hint style="info" %}
At this point your system tells you there are two Advanced REST Client applications installed: Chrome application and desktop client. The desktop client has slightly lighter shade of blue in application icon.
{% endhint %}

Select **File** &gt; **Import data** from application system menu.
