# Installing Advanced REST Client

## Installing Advanced REST Client

In most cases you can download the app from [https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/arc-electron/releases](https://github.com/advanced-rest-client/arc-electron/releases)

Find an installer for your platform under "Assets" section.

![Assets section for a release](.gitbook/assets/image%20%2839%29.png)

For example, for Windows you would download `arc-setup.exe`. For MacOS download `arc-13.0.7.dmg`.

{% hint style="info" %}
 Version number may be different to the one in the scree shoot. For normal use, please, download latest stable version.
{% endhint %}

When downloaded, run the file. The installed will walk you through the installation process.

## Linux installation

ARC's build process generates several builds for Linux. Find your platform and then architecture. Wrong architecture \(x86 instead of x64\) will result with error when installing or running the application.

Please note that ARC won't update automatically on Linux platform as this is not yet supported by the build library. This may be possible in the future.
